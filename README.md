# React info site

This is a very simple info page with a dark/light mode toggler. I built it as part of the first module of the [Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) by Scrimba.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
